MapReduce is a software framework introduced by Google to support distributed computing on large data sets on clusters of computers. While the concept is simple and powerful it is designed for large computing clusters. 
Jeocrowd wants to answer the question as to what happens when one replaces dedicated computing clusters with a large number of browsers running JavaScript programs. Contributing to a computational (Map-Reduce) job would then simply mean pointing your browser to a URL. Specifically, we will investigate a range of problems in the domain of geospatial data processing as to how suitable they are for processing using a Browser-based MapReduce approach.
